Help, it doesn't work!
======================

If ``oblif`` does not produce the expected outcome or gives an error, please first have a look at :ref:`cannot-do` to see if you are using ``oblif`` correctly.

Otherwise, pleas report an issue `here <https://github.com/meilof/oblif/issues>`_. In particular, you are challenged to produce a piece of code that:

 - works differently on non-oblivious values depending on whether or not the ``oblif`` decorator is applied; and/or
 - with the ``oblif`` decorator applied, provides different outputs depending on whether or not the inputs are data-oblivious values.
 
If you have such a piece of code, then please submit the code as an issue. Preferably, the example is as small as possible while still exhibiting the problem. Thank you!
