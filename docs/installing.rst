Installing
==========

``oblif`` is written in pure Python.

``oblif`` requires the ``bytecode`` package (``pip install bytecode``).

Since ``oblif`` works by transforming the underlying bytecode, it is only 
guaranteed to work with the regular CPython implementation. It also requires
a recent version of Python; Python 3.8 and 3.9 are known to work.
